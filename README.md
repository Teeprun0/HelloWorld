# This is my first project! ðŸ¥¹
In fact, at least it can't be called a project or even a semblance of a full-time job... but after all, almost every novice programmer starts with such a simple program **Hello World!**? Right? To be honest, I'm really pleased to start with just such a code example, it allows me to feel like I'm taking the first step into the C language and into the field of programming itself. ðŸ˜Œ

## A small fact ðŸ˜‰
I recently learned that it is a tradition to write the phrase **Hello World!** at the very beginning of any programming language, it began back in 1978 in the book "The C Programming Language, (Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kerrigan)", where the very phrase **Hello World!** was written at the very beginning of the I/O section. Did you also start with that phrase? ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜…

## I'll try to explain ðŸ˜¶
In this C code snippet, I used the "#include <iostream>" library from which I took "std::cout", then I wrote the main input function "int main", from which any project starts (unless another input function is explicitly defined initially), and in this function I I prescribed the main task of this whole project "std::cout << 'Hello World!'", which is the output to the console of our traditional phrase "Hello World!". And finally, I end the entire program via "return 0", which tells our program to end this entire process of work.
